              The Bodhisattva's path is not merely a string of virtues but a living architecture of realization. 
              Each transcendence, when seen clearly, is understood in <strong>six dimensions</strong>: its reality, 
              its cause, its result, its activity, its endowment, and its function. In this way, the path becomes 
              not vague idealism, but a precise unfolding. And in <strong>Maitreya</strong> — the gentle Friend 
              of all beings — we behold the perfection of this unfolding.

            <h2>The Perfection of Generosity</h2>
            
            <h3>The Reality and Cause of Generosity</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Generosity in its reality</strong> is the simple act of giving — placing one's treasure, 
              time, or wisdom in the hands of others. Yet this simplicity contains infinite depth.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its cause</strong> is freedom from the knot of greed, a will untangled from the hunger 
              of self. When the heart no longer grasps after possessions as sources of security or identity, 
              giving becomes as natural as breathing.
            </p>

            <h3>The Results and Activity of Generosity</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its result</strong> is abundance: not only the wealth of future lives, but the radiance 
              of a body filled with vitality and grace. The generous being attracts prosperity not through 
              grasping but through the natural flow of giving and receiving.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its activity</strong> is to serve both self and society, completing the stores of merit 
              and wisdom that blossom into enlightenment. Each act of generosity waters the seeds of awakening 
              while nourishing the garden of community.
            </p>

            <h3>The Endowment and Function of Generosity</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its endowment</strong> is the absence of avarice, a natural lightness of being that 
              knows no scarcity. The generous heart lives in an ever-abundant universe.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its function</strong> is threefold: the giving of goods, the giving of safety, and the 
              giving of truth. Material generosity meets bodily needs; protective generosity offers refuge 
              from fear; spiritual generosity shares the greatest treasure — wisdom that liberates.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-secondary-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
              <p className="text-gray-700 italic mb-0">
                Maitreya has fulfilled all three, pouring his compassion into the world as rain that never ceases — 
                offering material support to the needy, protection to the vulnerable, and teachings to those 
                who thirst for truth.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Perfection of Morality</h2>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Morality has six elements</strong>, each binding the restless self into the discipline of awakening. 
              Yet this discipline is not constraint but freedom — the natural expression of a heart aligned with truth.
            </p>

            <h3>The Foundation of Moral Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its cause</strong> is the yearning for serenity; <strong>its result</strong>, stability 
              of mind and rebirth in fortunate realms. A life lived in harmony with ethical principles naturally 
              produces the calm concentration needed for deeper realization.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its activity</strong> is the steady base of all virtues, the peace that cools the fires 
              of craving, the fearlessness that arises when no harm is sown. Moral conduct creates the conditions 
              in which wisdom can flourish.
            </p>

            <h3>The Living Expression of Morality</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its endowment</strong> is the inexhaustible store of merit. <strong>Its function</strong> 
              is expressed differently in vows — sometimes formal and conventional, sometimes natural and spontaneous.
            </p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary-200 pl-6 italic text-gray-700 my-8">
              <p className="text-lg">
                In Maitreya, morality is no restraint but a radiant dignity, harmonizing his actions with 
                the laws of truth. His very presence becomes a teaching on the beauty of the ethical life.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Perfection of Tolerance</h2>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Tolerance is threefold</strong>: patience with harm, endurance of suffering, and deep 
              knowledge that transforms both into wisdom. It is perhaps the most misunderstood of the perfections, 
              often confused with passive resignation.
            </p>

            <h3>The True Nature of Tolerance</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its cause</strong> is compassion joined with Dharma — not mere emotional sympathy, but 
              the clear understanding that beings harm others only when trapped in ignorance and suffering.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its result</strong> is five blessings: freedom from enmity, harmony with others, joy, 
              fearlessness in the face of death, and a heavenly rebirth. These fruits reveal tolerance not 
              as weakness but as ultimate strength.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Three Faces of Tolerance</h4>
              <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Patience with Harm:</strong> Maintaining composure when others act from ignorance</li>
                <li><strong>Endurance of Suffering:</strong> Accepting life's inevitable difficulties without bitterness</li>
                <li><strong>Transformative Knowledge:</strong> Seeing both harm and suffering as teachers on the path</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>The Power of Patient Endurance</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its activity</strong> is to secure the aims of self and others alike. <strong>Its endowment</strong> 
              is supreme asceticism, for tolerance is the highest austerity — more challenging than any physical discipline.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its function</strong> flourishes only in those who live without resentment. Tolerance 
              cannot be forced or faked; it arises naturally from the deep understanding of interdependence.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Maitreya, tolerance is not passive endurance but the majestic calm of a mountain unmoved 
              by storms. His patience with the slowness of beings to awaken spans countless eons, yet never 
              diminishes his compassionate activity.
            </p>

            <h2>The Perfection of Effort</h2>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Effort is the true enthusiasm for virtue.</strong> Far from the grim determination we 
              often associate with spiritual striving, authentic effort bubbles up from the joy of alignment 
              with our deepest nature.
            </p>

            <h3>The Source and Fruits of Effort</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its cause</strong> is faith and will — not blind belief, but the confidence born of 
              seeing the path's effectiveness, coupled with the determination to walk it completely.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its result</strong> is the growth of mindfulness and concentration. Sustained effort 
              naturally develops the mental factors essential for realization.
            </p>

            <h3>The Transformative Power of Right Effort</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Its activity</strong> is to cut through addictive tendencies and the inertia of ignorance. 
              Like a sword of wisdom, right effort slices through the habits that bind us to suffering.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Its endowment</strong> is the cluster of virtues — non-greed, clarity, determination — 
              that make the path unstoppable. These qualities reinforce each other in an upward spiral of growth.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Sevenfold Function of Effort</h4>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Effort manifests as tireless exertion of body and mind across the three trainings:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-1 text-gray-700 text-sm">
                <li>• Physical effort in moral conduct and service</li>
                <li>• Mental effort in developing concentration</li>
                <li>• Wisdom effort in studying and contemplating the teachings</li>
                <li>• Effort in generating bodhicitta</li>
                <li>• Effort in accumulating merit</li>
                <li>• Effort in purifying obstacles</li>
                <li>• Effort in dedicating all virtue to the awakening of all beings</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              In Maitreya, effort burns like a sacred fire, never exhausted, always directed toward the 
              liberation of all beings. His enthusiasm for the welfare of others has sustained him through 
              countless lifetimes and will carry him to perfect Buddhahood.
            </p>

            <h2>The Living Integration</h2>
            
            <p>
              Thus <strong>generosity, morality, tolerance, and effort</strong> reveal themselves not as 
              abstract ideals, but as living realities perfected in the Bodhisattva Maitreya — the pattern 
              and promise of the path itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              In him, we see how each perfection contains and enhances all others: his generosity is moral 
              and patient and energetic; his morality is generous and tolerant and sustained by effort; 
              his tolerance is generous and ethical and actively compassionate; his effort is generous 
              and moral and infinitely patient.
            </p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-secondary-200 pl-6 italic text-gray-700 my-8">
              <p className="text-lg">
                The perfections are not separate attainments but facets of a single jewel — the awakened 
                heart that sees all beings as itself and acts spontaneously for their welfare.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
            
            <p>
              For those walking the bodhisattva path, these four perfections offer both challenge and 
              encouragement. They show us that the highest spiritual attainments have their roots in 
              simple, everyday choices: the choice to give rather than hoard, to act ethically rather 
              than selfishly, to endure difficulties with grace, and to persist in virtue despite obstacles.
