        <p className="text-xl mb-12 text-gray-600 italic leading-relaxed font-light">
          There are six bridges a determined seeker must cross if they wish to leave behind the narrowness of self and step into the vast work of serving all. Each is different in form, but together they create a single path, firm and unbroken.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">The First Bridge: Generous Letting Go</h2>
        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          The first bridge is the giving away of what one once clung to. Here, the heart is trained to release its grip, until even the thought of "mine" dissolves. This is not mere charity, but a fundamental reorientation of how we relate to the world around us.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          True generosity reveals the illusory nature of ownership. When we give without attachment to outcome, we begin to understand that abundance flows through us, not from us. This practice connects deeply with <Link to="/articles/compassion-action" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">the cultivation of active compassion</Link>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">The Second Bridge: Ethical Conduct</h2>
        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          The second is the ordering of life in a way that causes no harm. It shapes the body, the speech, and the mind into instruments of trust. This foundation of ethical living creates the stability necessary for deeper practice.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          Ethics here is not rigid moralism but skillful living—understanding how our actions create ripples throughout the web of existence. When we align our behavior with wisdom, we become a blessing to all we encounter. This alignment resonates with <Link to="/articles/mindfulness-modern-life" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">mindful approaches to daily living</Link>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">The Third Bridge: Patient Endurance</h2>
        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          The third is the quiet strength to remain open in the face of injury—so that no insult, pain, or betrayal can convince the heart to turn away from serving others. This patience becomes a shield that protects our compassion from the world's inevitable difficulties.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          Patience is not passive acceptance but active engagement with the present moment, regardless of its content. When we stop demanding that life conform to our preferences, we discover an unshakeable peace that no external circumstance can disturb. This quality is explored further in <Link to="/articles/inner-guru-wisdom" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">teachings on inner guidance</Link>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">The Fourth Bridge: Enthusiastic Effort</h2>
        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          The fourth bridge is tireless striving. This is not the frantic motion of ambition, but the steady, unbroken pulse of one who does not abandon the good halfway. It is the energy that sustains practice through all seasons of the spiritual journey.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          True effort flows from understanding rather than willpower. When we see clearly the benefits of practice and the cost of unconsciousness, right action becomes effortless. This sustainable approach to spiritual growth is explored in <Link to="/articles/soul-purpose" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">discovering your soul's calling</Link>.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-100 to-indigo-100 p-8 rounded-lg mb-10 border-l-4 border-blue-500">
          <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            "The fourth bridge teaches us that spiritual progress requires not force but flow—the natural movement of a heart aligned with its highest purpose."
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">The Fifth Bridge: Meditative Concentration</h2>
        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          The fifth is the deep settling of the mind, where restless winds grow still and the currents of thought run clear. In this stillness, the seeker discovers an unshakeable peace that becomes the foundation for wisdom.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          Concentration is not suppression but natural gathering—like water finding its level or a flame rising straight in still air. From this unified awareness, we perceive reality with unprecedented clarity. This practice connects with <Link to="/articles/meditation-techniques" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">various approaches to contemplative practice</Link>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">The Sixth Bridge: Penetrating Wisdom</h2>
        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          The sixth is the seeing that cuts through illusion—a vision so sharp it mistakes nothing for truth, yet so gentle it holds all beings without judgment. This wisdom transforms every other practice, making them expressions of understanding rather than mere techniques.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          Wisdom here is not intellectual knowledge but direct perception of how things actually are. It recognizes the interdependence of all phenomena and the empty, open nature of awareness itself. This recognition fundamentally transforms our relationship to existence, as discussed in <Link to="/articles/consciousness-exploration" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">explorations of pure awareness</Link>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">The Interconnected Path</h2>
        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          Crossing these bridges changes the seeker. They no longer weigh gain against loss, for the joy of serving eclipses the old calculations. They can be in the world without being owned by it. They can act without draining themselves, for their roots run into a source that does not dry.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          Each bridge strengthens the others. The discipline that guards one's conduct supports the patience that refuses to retaliate. The calm mind born of meditation feeds the clarity of wisdom. The boundless giving of the open hand naturally fuels the energy to keep going.
        </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            To live this way is to move toward a shore one may never reach in a single lifetime, yet every step leaves the world more whole than it was before.
