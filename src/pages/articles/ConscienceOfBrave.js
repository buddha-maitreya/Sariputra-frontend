          How refined conscience becomes the hidden compass of authentic spiritual transformation
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p className="text-xl mb-8 text-gray-600 italic">
          Within the vast and noble path walked by those who vow to serve all beings, conscience becomes the hidden compass, sharper than a sword, softer than a lotus, and more enduring than any celestial jewel.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">The Transfigured Conscience</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          This is no ordinary conscience—timid, reactive, or burdened by cultural guilt. It is a transfigured awareness, born from the marrow of wisdom and shaped by boundless compassion. The brave ones who tread the seeker's path cultivate a conscience that rejects even the blameless if it falls short of universal service.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This sacred conscience is not simply a psychological echo of past wrongs; it is a knowing heart that cannot bear laziness in the face of suffering or indulgence in trivial attainments. Even the paths of personal liberation, though pure, appear limited when seen through the lens of a dedicated seeker's vast aspiration.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">The Sacred Ache</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Their conscience will not allow them to rest in self-contentment while sentient beings still cry out in confusion. The narrower path, though unstained, is perceived as insufficient—not through arrogance, but through an overwhelming urge to serve the whole.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          When resistance to virtue arises—when the fires of generosity, patience, or morality are smothered by distraction and defilement—the advanced seeker feels an unbearable ache. Not for themselves, but for the regress of their vows. If they find themselves fervent in activities rooted in attachment, yet sluggish in the six liberative practices, their conscience becomes a storm that cannot be silenced.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This is not moral panic—it is sacred regret, a cry from the depths of their evolutionary intent.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">The Diamond Conscience</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Yet not all conscience is equal. Some are diluted by pride, weakened by lack of focus, or constrained by low aspirations. The conscience of the truly brave is like a diamond sharpened by lifetimes of resolve. It does not operate for approval or reward but from the deep-rooted recognition that each moment unawakened is a betrayal of truth.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Such a conscience becomes a torch, lighting the way for others to develop that same luminous sensitivity—a transmission of inner nobility. The dedicated seeker's regret is not neurotic; it is prophetic. It does not paralyze but refines, deepens, and resurrects the vow again and again.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mt-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500">
          This is how the future awakened ones are born—not in external perfection, but in the fierce quiet of a conscience that cannot forget the suffering of the world.
